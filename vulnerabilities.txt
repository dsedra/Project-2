Though we are not sure this is a vulnerability, we are not certain of when to close a connection. Previously we had thought that when the select loop indicated that there was data on a file descriptor and read returned 0, that there was an error and the connection should be closed. However, the connection was terminated after the first request and did not remain alive for further interaction.
